            <h2>Ambition and Intent</h2>
            <p class="intro">A lot of companies talk about passion, and we think that&rsquo;s important too. But at Unmetric we talk about ambition, which is for every organization to have better intelligence in order to confidently make more informed business decisions and compete in the data-led economy.</p>
            <p class="intro">We support this ambition with a laser-focused intent to enable &lsquo;data heroes&rsquo; to understand their competitors efforts, uncover insights based on data, and unlock new social strategies for their brand(s).</p>

            <h2>Data is our Inspiration</h2>
            <p class="intro">Data is certainly en vogue in the business world, and it&rsquo;s become a bit of a cottage industry. Of course we love data, and we&rsquo;re guessing you do too. 
            <p>If that&rsquo;s the case, you might be interested in some of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/lm/RVETKNGV5ZKML/ref=cm_lm_pthnk_view?ie=UTF8&lm_bb=" target="_blank">these books</a>. If videos are more your thing, check out this list of <a href="http://www.ted.com/playlists/56/making_sense_of_too_much_data" target="_blank">TED talks</a> featuring brilliant insights on the deluge of data we face in our current culture. We especially like <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/shyam_sankar_the_rise_of_human_computer_cooperation" target="_blank">this one</a> from Shyam Sankar on human-computer cooperation. In it he references <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider" target="_blank">J.C.R. Licklider</a>, one of the titans of computer science and an early evangelist for the power of human-computer symbiosis, a concept that we&rsquo;ve adopted as part of our methodology.</p>

            <h2>We&rsquo;re More than a Data Company</h2>
            <p class="intro">We&rsquo;re a people company that happens to provide data (to other people). What type of people are we? The &ldquo;let the girlfriend of a prospective employee interview the CEO before the boyfriend takes the job&rdquo; kind. The &ldquo;hangout with clients even after the party is over&rdquo; kind. The &ldquo;let a client sleep over at your house when he&rsquo;s in town&rdquo; kind. And yes, those are all true stories.</p>

               <p>Data or dessert? While a little under 50% named apple their favorite pie, the rest voted for chart or 3.14 as their favorites.</p>
